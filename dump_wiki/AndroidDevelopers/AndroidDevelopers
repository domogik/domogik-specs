!Ideas for future
!!Home wifi detection
The idea is to check the wifi network : if the application detects a known wifi connexion, is sends an xpl message (how? via rest?) to tell where it is : 
* home
* work
* etc

The idea is to know who is home (for example)

The other (and main!) idea is to switch REST url from external (internet) to internal (wifi) to increase responses speed.

!!Lost phone feature
Regulary send to the xpl network (how? via rest?) an xpl message to tell the GPS location of phone. This should be secure (ssl or other).
