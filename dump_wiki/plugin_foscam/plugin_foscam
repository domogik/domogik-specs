Purpose
********
This plugin was design to control foscam camera relay command.

{img fileId="272" thumb="y" rel="box[g]" title="foscam photo" alt="foscam photo"}

Right now this plugin was tested with :
* FI8908W
* But should work with all fosam equiped with relay command.

*************
Prerequisite
*************
Domogik server should be able to access the foscam camera using http protocol. So be sure to open firewall if necessary.

This plugin doesn't use any specific python package.

plug your relay on pin 1 and 2 according to this picture :
{img fileId="273" thumb="y" rel="box[g]" title="foscam relay" alt="foscam relay"}

*********************
Plugin configuration
*********************
Enabling plugin
================
You can enable plugin by using :
.. code-block::
    
    dmgenplug foscam
    

You just have to reload administration page to see the plugin in the list.

Configuration
==============
In Domogik administration, go to foscam configuration page.
The plugin is preconfigured with an example :

{img fileId="271" thumb="y" rel="box[g]" title="foscam plugin" alt="foscam plugin"}

Name
*****
Give a name to each camera you add, this name will be the adress device.

Ip
***
Could also be a dns name

port
*****
use to reach the cam, default on is already 80.

user &amp; password
********************
It's recommend not to use "admin", so i suggest you to create a new one from your foscam camera web site, and set a password too !

delay
******
I implement this command for my special need, i will explain it a little later on this page, probably you never use it, so you could leave the default value for now (5).

Don't forget to save your configuration...

Device
=======
Now it's time to create a device, stay in the administration section, but move to Organisation/Devices. On the Devices List, hit "+" .

{img fileId="270" thumb="y" rel="box[g]" title="Device
" alt="Device"}

Name
*****
Enter the name of your choice

Address
********
Rewrite exatly the plugin interface name your had enter in the previous chapter.

Feature
********
Choose Foscam Camera and Relay

Usage
******
Choose the icon you want.

Description &amp; Reference
****************************
Not use.

Start plugin
=============
So go back to the plugin configuraion and start the plugin (start button).

place the widget
=================
 Switch
********
Move to Organisation / Widgets
Select the aera where you want to see the widget, a windows should appear, where you should see all your devices. Select the foscam device, switch and Basic widget.

{img fileId="269" thumb="y" rel="box[g]" title="Widget placement" alt="Widget placement"} 

You should go back to visualisation mode and  your widget sould work.

In this example I made you select a switch widget which is an actuator LOW(open)/HIGH(close), each time you hit it, the relay switch from Open to Close to Open...etc

 Trigger
*********
In some case relay should only be in contact for a specific duration. I implement Pulse command for this need.
If you need a such thing, folow the switch paragraph, just select trigger instead of switch.
Each time you hit the widget, your relay will be in contact and after a delay, release.This delay can be set in the plugin configuration page.
