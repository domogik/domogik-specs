The Domogik project is designed to provide a user friendly interface to manage Home Automation devices using a web interface.

This project is developed by French people but most of the documentation is written in English so that (almost) everybody can understand us (:biggrin:).
But the next goal is to publish all documents at least in French, in addition to English. Other languages will follow later.

So, if you want to join the project as a translator, feel free to contact us through the general mailing list:

[http://lists.labs.libre-entreprise.org/mailman/listinfo/domogik-general|Mailing list] or join irc.freenode.net / #domogik

Your help will be appreciated!
