!Use Case 1 - Address split in 2 sub addresses
!!Example 
In rfxcom plugin, there is an __ac.basic__ schema : 
{CODE()}
ac.basic
{
address=&lt;0x1..0x3ffffffff&gt;
unit=&lt;1..16&gt;
command=...
...
}
{CODE}
To address the device, you must specify address AND unit. So /command must be able to use 2 addresses (address and unit) to create the xPL
!!What has been done
solved in 0.x.x-deviceparams
the address is removed from a device config, now this can be configured by multiple values


!Use Case 2 - Multi technology plugins
!!Example
Rfxcom handle several technologies : homeeasy, x10, ...
Several technologies can need the same order (on, off, ...).

!!What has been done
solved in 0.x.x-deviceparams
a plugin doens't define a technology anymore, it only defines device_types

!Use case 3 - Give access to list and ressources of usages by RINOR
!!Example 
All UIs may use new usages by getting then from RINOR (/usage/list, /usage/...) and also get the different icons with RINOR

!!What has to be done

!Use case 4 - Group of features/ Virtual devices

!Use case 5 - Can send extra attributes, with a command
!!Example
For relay box (ipx800) the box has a unique address, so the command needs to send the action, AND the relay id
For KNX the KNX datatype is required for conversion before sending to the bus

!Use case 6 - Calculated values
How to have calculated values based on features values, constants, formulas

!Use case 7 - Specific Target
Some xpl equipment, like an arduino, could have multiple instance on the network.  The XPL protocol allows to target a specific instance of a device like:
{CODE()}target=arduino-rgb.parentsbedroom
target=arduino-rgb.kitchen{CODE}
But for the moment, Domogik permits only  broadcast target.

!Use case 8 - Multiples states command
For group command (like OFF ALL), multiple responses can be received, with no direct link to the original command.
Need to find a way to catch them all, and display a summary on UI.

!!What has been done
solved in 0.x.x-deviceparams
a device_type can have multiple sensors to catch all those states, or it can even have multiple xpl_stats linked to one sensor

!Use case 9 - The Up, Down and Stop 
Shutters are managed using the 3 commands : up, down and stop. Need to have 3 commands in a feature to do it.

!!What has been done
solved in 0.x.x-deviceparams
a device_type can have multiple commands
