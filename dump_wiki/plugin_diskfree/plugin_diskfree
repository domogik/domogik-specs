xPL Schema 
============
The `sensor.basic <http://xplproject.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Schema\_-\_SENSOR.BASIC>`_ schema is used by this plugin.

Four messages are sent for each path check. There is one message per type : 
* type=free_space
* type=used_space
* type=total_space
* type=percent_used

Values are in kbyte forfree, used and total space. Percent used is a percent.
On __xpl-stat__ is used by this plugin :
.. code-block::
    
    xpl-stat
    {
    ...
    }
    sensor.basic
    {
    device=<path>
    type=<free_space, used_space, total_space, percent_used>
    current=<value>
    }
