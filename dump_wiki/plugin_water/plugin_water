Different parts of plugin
==========================
Legionella killing
*******************
One day by month, the temperature must be 65°C to kill legionalle (killed at 60°C).
We need : 
* one order to make temperature going to 65°C : see function __heat_to_65__.
* one way to know when doing this (day/hour)
** hour : a plugin parameter
** day : 2 parameters : 
*** number of the day in the period (1..7 for a week, 1..28 for a month)
*** period type : month or week
* a way to know that action append (people safety!)
** mail ?
** sms ?
** script (which would do the mail/sms/xpl message send/etc)?
** ==> See how to do this

Force water to 65°C
********************
This will make the temperature going to 65°C : see function __heat_to_65__.
We need : 
* a xPL listener for heating order
* the function to do the action

Consumption analysis
*********************
Each day of the week, the water consumption should be analysed to get water volume used in the day. This will be used for the day "d+7" to heat water.
In the first time, we may use last week data.
In a second time, we may use a formula which make a smart calculation with last weeks.

__Warning : to do this, we need to store and read data!!! How to do this ?__

When doing the calculation ?
* at midnight ?

What do we do if plugin is stopped for several days ?

Water heating in function of analysis
**************************************
Input ?
* a temperature for "output temperature" ?



Formulas
=========
__Warning : formula in french for the moment__
.. code-block::
    
    "Quantité d'eau à 40°=-LN((T°sortie-T°entrée)/V40*100) x Volume du ballon"
    

FAQ
====
Why not using a scenarii to set when heating to kill legionella ?
******************************************************************
Because this would need a manual configuration. This is a critical (people safety) feature.
