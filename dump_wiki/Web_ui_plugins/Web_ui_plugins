!Web UI : the plugins
{maketoc}
!!Ideas
!!!Tabs
Use http://hanshillen.github.com/aegisdemo/#

!!!Multi interface more friendly

!!!Helpers integration

!!!Plugin's resources view

!!Screens
!!!Header
Like for rooms, the header could have a (fixed by the plugin) background image that should represent the plugin.

A plugin gives no picture with it (because a plugin has no UI part), so the UI will take the picture in a dedicated folder and find it with name &quot;foo.png&quot; if the plugin is named &quot;foo&quot;.

!!!Points to see : 
* Host, technology and status should be more visible.
* For the link to help, maybe an icon somewhere on the right?
