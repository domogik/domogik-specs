Header
*******
Like for rooms, the header could have a (fixed by the plugin) background image that should represent the plugin.

A plugin gives no picture with it (because a plugin has no UI part), so the UI will take the picture in a dedicated folder and find it with name "foo.png" if the plugin is named "foo".

Points to see : 
*****************
* Host, technology and status should be more visible.
* For the link to help, maybe an icon somewhere on the right?
