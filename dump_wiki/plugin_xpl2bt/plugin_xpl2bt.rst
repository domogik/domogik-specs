This plugin is only a bridge between bluetooth devices using the xPL protocol, and a xPL bus. It has no specific xPL message.

In this first version, it is able to connect to specified remote bluetooth devices, using RFCOMM protocol. 

In future versions, some control and fault tolerance mechanisms should be implemented. The user should also be able to specify which messages should be forwarded, to avoid useless transmission. Other energy saving strategies could be implemented.
