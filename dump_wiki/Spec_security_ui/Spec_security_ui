This document will gather all techniques and ideas to secure Domogik UI access.

!! Requirements
* The link between the REST API and the UI should be secure (HTTPS use)
* The link between the Web browser and DomoWeb should be secure (HTTPS use)
* The REST API should have an authentification method, with multiple session handeling.
* DomoWeb should base the authentification and session on REST API authentification process.
* 2 different security level between Internal access and External access
** Internal access: Only the Admin section require auth. View auth is optional. Large connection time
** External access: Both  Admin and view sections require auth, Shorter connection time
** External public access: A stronger auth methode can be used for very unsecure access. (One time password)
